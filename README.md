Recommendation system for udemy users.

Motivation:
I choose courses on udemy by checking out ratings, number of enrollments for the courses, and by watching preview and intro videos. 
I basically spent lots of time to invest my money to enroll in a course on udemy. Hence I decided to develop a personalized 
recommendation system and web app for udemy users.



The dataset was obtained from Udemy api
